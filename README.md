# Dotfiles 🏡

Welcome to my personal dotfiles repository! This is where I keep all my configuration files to ensure a consistent and comfortable environment across my systems.

Currently, you'll find configurations for:

    ✨ Neovim (nvim): My preferred text editor, tweaked for maximum productivity and a delightful coding experience.
    💻 Sway: My tiling Wayland compositor, configured for an efficient and beautiful desktop.

🚀 Latest Changes

The most up-to-date configurations and ongoing developments are always pushed to the wayland branch. If you're looking for the bleeding edge, that's the place to be!

Feel free to explore, fork, or adapt anything you find useful! 🤓
